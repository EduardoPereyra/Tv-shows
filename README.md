# Assignment README

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate the candidate's proficiency in frontend technologies, programming patterns, and to showcase a sample of clean and reusable code. Additionally, it aims to assess the candidate's basic design knowledge.

## Requirement

Create an application using the [TVmaze API](http://www.tvmaze.com/api) that allows users to view TV shows based on different genres (drama, comedy, sports, etc.). The application should display popular TV shows on a dashboard, organized by rating and genre. When a user clicks on a TV show, the details should be shown on another screen. Users should also be able to search for a TV show. Design a responsive and mobile-friendly UI for this purpose.

## Architecture

Design the application with a focus on clean code, reusability, and frontend best practices. There is no specific limit on architecture; design it as you see fit. Demonstrate your ability to produce high-quality applications.

## Notes

- Use Angular framework and Ionic for this assignment.
- Ensure the application is responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Minimize the use of scaffolding tools, boilerplate templates, and plugins. While not expecting everything to be created from scratch, we would like to see your unique contributions.
- Include a readme file explaining your architectural decisions, such as why you chose a specific framework. Provide instructions on how to run the solution, details about the NodeJS version used, and NPM.
- Include unit tests for your application.
- Verify that the application runs without console errors before submission.
- Keep the UI simple yet eye-catching.
- Feel free to incorporate additional features beyond those specified in the assignment.
